# ANSITrek
A Game inspired by Super Star Trek and other similar vintage games.  It
takes advantage of the ANSIterm project to present an interface more similar
to trek52 on the PDP-11.

Since there are very few terminals left anymore the interface assumes
an adjustable ANSI style terminal interface with dimensions of 132x48
(the dimensions may change as the user interface gets developed).
